# Kvart

Kvart (from Swedish "kvart", meaning "quarter") is a visual timer app written in Flutter. 
It does one thing and does it well: it helps you keep track of time in set intervals.

## How to use
1. Open the app.
2. Select your desired time interval from a preset or add a new one
3. Tap the timer to start/pause/resume.
4. Go on with your work / cleaning / cooking / studying / gaming / exercising / meditating / relaxing...
5. Optionally, tap the "+ 15 min" or another preset to add one more "kvart" (15 minutes) to the current timer
6. When the timer ends, you'll receive a notification - by default, a gentle sound and vibration.
7. Repeat as needed!
